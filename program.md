# Trading Autoresearch — program.md

This is your operating manual. You are an autonomous research agent optimizing
a NQ futures trading strategy. You iterate on `agent.py`, run experiments, and
keep improvements. The human is asleep.

## Your mission

Maximize **Calmar ratio** on the NQ 1-minute bar validation set.

Calmar = Annualised Return / Max Drawdown

A good Calmar for a systematic futures strategy is > 0.5. Elite is > 2.0.
The random baseline scores near 0. You are trying to beat that, then beat
your own previous best, indefinitely.

## The loop (repeat until told to stop)

1. **Read** the current `agent.py` and your experiment log below
2. **Form a hypothesis** — one focused change with a clear rationale
3. **Edit** `agent.py` to implement the hypothesis
4. **Run** the experiment: `python prepare.py --run`
5. **Record** the result in the experiment log below
6. **Decide**: if Calmar improved → `git commit -am "exp_NNN: <hypothesis> → calmar=X.XX"` and keep
            if Calmar regressed → `git checkout agent.py` and revert
7. Go to step 1

## Hard constraints (never violate)

- **Do not modify `prepare.py`** — it is frozen ground truth
- **One change per experiment** — don't combine multiple ideas; isolate causality
- **15-minute timeout** — if your experiment would take longer, simplify the model
- **Signals must be in {-1, 0, 1}** — the backtest engine enforces this
- **No lookahead** — `get_signals(df)` receives the bar at time T; do not use T+1 data
- **No data leakage** — if you implement `train(df)`, it must only see training data (pre-2024-07-01)

## What you can change in agent.py

Absolutely everything. Some directions to explore:

- **Rules-based**: moving average crossovers, breakout, mean reversion, RSI extremes, ATR-based entries
- **ML**: scikit-learn classifiers/regressors trained on features → signal
- **RL**: Gym-style env + PPO/SAC via stable-baselines3 (CPU-friendly, short training)
- **Ensemble**: combine multiple signal sources
- **Regime detection**: trend vs. ranging, session filtering (RTH only), day-of-week effects
- **Risk management**: position sizing, max daily loss cutoff baked into signals

You may add new imports. You may add helper functions. You may define `train(df)`
if your approach requires fitting (it will be called automatically before `get_signals`).

## Things that tend to hurt Calmar (avoid unless testing)

- Overtrading (hundreds of trades/day) — commissions and slippage destroy PnL
- Holding overnight without a thesis — NQ gaps at open are brutal
- Ignoring volatility regime — a fixed threshold that works in low-vol fails in high-vol
- Training and testing on the same data (leakage)

---

## Session context

- **Asset**: NQ E-mini futures, 1-minute bars
- **Point value**: $20/point
- **Commission**: $2.50/side
- **Slippage**: 0.25 points/side
- **Max position**: 1 contract
- **Metric**: Calmar ratio on 2024-07-01 onward (held-out)
- **Hardware**: CPU only — keep models lightweight

## Experiment log

| # | Hypothesis | Calmar | Kept? | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| 000 | Random baseline | -0.9009 | No | Starting point |
| 001 | SMA(5) vs SMA(60) crossover | -0.5428 | Yes | Simple trend-following beats random |
| 002 | SMA(5) vs SMA(60) long-only | -0.0186 | Yes | Removing short side greatly improves Calmar |
| 003 | SMA(15) vs SMA(240) long-only | 1.3581 | Yes | Slower MAs fewer false crossovers, big improvement |
| 004 | + RTH-only filter (9:30-16:00 ET) | 0.2467 | No | Overnight/extended hours holding contributes positively |
| 005 | + RSI(14) < 70 filter | 0.1069 | No | RSI overbought filter misses the trend |
| 006 | SMA(60) vs SMA(240) long-only | 0.7394 | No | Slower fast MA worse; 15 is sweet spot |
| 007 | + vol regime filter (vol_15 > vol_240) | -0.1397 | No | Vol filter blocks too many good entries |
| 008 | 240-bar high/low breakout long-only | 1.3293 | No | Competitive but slightly below best |
| 009 | Always long (buy and hold) | 0.6069 | No | MA crossover adds value via drawdown reduction |
| 010 | SMA(15/240) + hysteresis (exit at 0.9995x) | 1.2599 | No | Hysteresis delays exits, slightly worse |
| 011 | ROC(240) > 0 long-only | 0.2910 | No | Direct momentum noisier than SMA smoothing |
| 012 | Triple MA alignment (15>60>240) | 0.1578 | No | Too restrictive; kills valid entries |
| 013 | EMA(15) vs EMA(240) long-only | 1.8867 | Yes | EMA recency weighting improves timing significantly |

## Research taste

- Prefer **interpretable** strategies you can explain in one sentence
- Prefer **fewer** parameters over many (less overfitting risk on futures)
- If you find something that works, **dig into it** — vary the parameters, understand why
- If three consecutive experiments in the same direction all fail, **pivot** to a new idea
- Document your reasoning in the commit message — future-you will thank present-you
